# useAction

Almost same to useEffect, but not deferred.

## Why `useAction`?

> Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, the function passed to useEffect fires after layout and paint, during a deferred event. This makes it suitable for the many common side effects, like setting up subscriptions and event handlers, because most types of work shouldnâ€™t block the browser from updating the screen.

From [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#timing-of-effects).

But `useAction` can execute the action function immediately after `useAction` get called.

## Example

### useEffect

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  ref = useRef(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = 'initialized'
  }, [])
  console.log(ref.current) // -> null
  return null
}
```

### useAction

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  ref = useRef(null)
  useAction(() => {
    ref.current = 'initialized'
  }, [])
  console.log(ref.current) // -> initialized
  return null
}
```
